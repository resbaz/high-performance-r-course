# High Performance R Course

A course explaining how to make your R-Code run faster. 
* We explore how to profile (where are the bottlenecks) and optimise your code. 
* We also explore how to use make the best of your computer's power with parallelisation.
* The final part of the course explores what other options there are @unimelb for running your code in the cloud or at a high preformance computer.

### The Material is divided into two sections

* **Part 1:** Presentation on how to make your code run faster in your computer [here](https://resbaz.github.io/high-performance-r-course/Part1_Presentation.html)
    + Corresponding challenges with solutions ([here](https://resbaz.github.io/high-performance-r-course/Challenges.nb.html))


* **Part 2:** Cloud and HPC at Melbourne University [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/resbaz/high-performance-r-course/blob/master/Part2_HPC.html)

TODO: HPC bit is missing in the repository.
Work-in-progress.
